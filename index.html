				<p class="author">Information Technology Based Upstarts</p>
				<p>
					Build your own subsidiary instead of relying on outsourced teams that do not buy-in to your 
					company's culture, mission and vision. For almost the same costs as outsourced developers, you 
					can provide more value to your team by cutting out the middle men who are shamelessly
					making big money from the work of others. 
				</p>

			<div class="t">
				<p class="author">Knowledge-based Professionals</p>
				<p>
					The Philippines is an open market for English speaking professionals. From visual artists, teachers, copywriters and editors, 
					to competent paralegals, accountants, architects and engineers,	you are better off starting your own company 
					in the country than hiring independent contractors and outsourcing firms. Start your operations in no time 
					while minimizing your risks of failure as we guide you from the	ins and outs of running a successful business in the Philippines.

				<p class="author">Small Professional Businesses</p>
				<p>
					Small professional businesses in the Philippines need a technology boost to increase productivity. 
					Our Enterprise Launchpad enables these enterprises to compete with a reputable professional 
					online presence. Manage content for a basic web page and setup free e-mail accounts under 
					your own ops.ph subdomain (like info@mybusiness.ops.ph) with ease and convenience.
